Changes to original files:
Timeline.js - renamed to jsx extension (Timeline.jsx)

Note: Saving name changes of items does not work.

## Follow-up questions:
## 1   How long you spent on the assignment.
	- 3.5 hours

## 2   What you like about your implementation.
	- Ability to toggle between editting items.

## 3   What you would change if you were going to do it again.
	- How items are being assigned and put into rows.  I think generally, timelines look more similar to line graphs and I wanted to set items into their designated months and days throughout the year.  I did not have a good idea of how I wanted to implement the frontend design-wise.
	- Instead of a global button to toggle between editting mode, items can have their own individual edit buttons.  It would be easier to edit single items.  However, it might make it a hassle if multiple items need to be editted, though, as the user would need to click each item to edit it.  It would also clog the UI.
	-  I need to figure out how to space items on a yearly grid so that it's easier to distinguish what items are coming up on the timeline.
	- Item's overall duration do not match up with the width of the item.  This makes items seem longer/shorter than they actually are.  Would need to fix this.

## 4   How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
	- The pastel color backgrounds for each item was inspired by Google calendar and their unique colors for each account and their events.
	- I did not have any further inspiration from other timelines when implementing this.  However, my first point in the third follow-up question was inspired by timelines I have seen in past experiences.

## 5   How you would test this if you had more time.
	- If I had more time I would find a way to implement saving editted names of items.  Testing its responsiveness on mobile would be great, too.  I did not have time to write responsive css.
